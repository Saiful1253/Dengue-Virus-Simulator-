# Dengue Virus Simulator (C++ GUI)

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Dengue Virus Simulator** is a C++ GUI-based simulation project designed to model and visualize the spread and behavior of the Dengue virus. This project is mainly developed for **educational and academic purposes**, helping students understand how virus transmission works through simulation.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Simulate Dengue virus transmission behavior
* Visualize infection spread using a graphical user interface
* Demonstrate core simulation logic using C++
* Help students learn GUI programming and basic modeling concepts

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Programming Language:** C++
* **GUI Framework:** (Qt / SFML / WinAPI – mention the one you used)
* **IDE:** Visual Studio / Code::Blocks (optional)

---

## ✨ Features

* GUI-based interactive simulation
* Start / stop simulation controls
* Visual representation of infected and non-infected areas
* Real-time simulation updates
* Simple and user-friendly interface
